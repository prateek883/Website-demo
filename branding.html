                        <h3> Branding is strategic. Marketing is tactical. </h3>
                        <p>
                            Marketing may contribute to a brand, but the brand is bigger than any particular marketing effort. The brand is what remains
                            after the marketing has swept through the room. It’s what sticks in your mind associated with
                            a product, service, or organization— whether or not, at that particular moment, you bought or
                            did not buy. The brand is ultimately what determines if you will become a loyal customer or not.
                            The marketing may convince you to buy a particular Toyota, and maybe it’s the first foreign car
                            you ever owned, but it is the brand that will determine if you will only buy Toyotas for the
                            rest of your life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The brand is built from many things. Very important among these things is the lived experience of the brand. Did that car
                            deliver on its brand promise of reliability? Did the maker continue to uphold the quality standards
                            that made them what they are? Did the sales guy or the service center mechanic know what they
                            were talking about? Marketing unearths and activates buyers. Branding makes loyal customers,
                            advocates, even evangelists, out of those who buy. This works the same way for all types of businesses
                            and organizations. All organizations must sell (including nonprofits). How they sell may differ,
                            and everyone in an organization is, with their every action, either constructing or deconstructing
                            the brand. Every thought, every action, every policy, every ad, every marketing promotion has
                            the effect of either inspiring or deterring brand loyalty in whomever is exposed to it. All of
                            this affects sales.

                            Back to our financial expert. Is marketing a cost center? Poorly researched and executed marketing activities can certainly
                            be a cost center, but well-researched and well-executed marketing is an investment that pays
                            for itself in sales and brand reinforcement. Is branding a cost center? On the surface, yes,
                            but the return is loyalty. The return is sales people whose jobs are easier and more effective,
                            employees who stay longer and work harder, customers who become ambassadors and advocates for
                            the organization. Branding is as vital to the success of a business or nonprofit as having financial
                            coherence, having a vision for the future, or having quality employees. It is the essential foundation
                            for a successful operation. So yes, it’s a cost center, like good employees, financial experts,
                            and business or organizational innovators are. They are cost centers, but what is REALLY costly
                            is not to have them, or to have substandard ones.

                            Marketing. Your initial video needs to be a good representation of your brand. It also needs
                            to be interesting enough to be viewed, liked and shared across the internet through your brand’s
                            pages and by others. Design Pros can get your brand set up corrrectly and started in the right
